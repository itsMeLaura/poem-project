Unable

bald in bold 
i stand unable and unsteady 
before woman before man
terrifies to a pant
anxious and alone
my soul, my shadow, wants to show
my inner wonderful terrible world
a 'must-trot' bald in bold
a follow
all the while, i,
unable to stand steady
before woman before man
to show a shadow to the world.
